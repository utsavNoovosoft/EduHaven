# Preventing Render Cold Starts

## Background
The Eduhaven backend is hosted on **Render Free Tier**, which automatically puts the instance to sleep after around **50 seconds** of inactivity.  
When the instance wakes up (cold start), it causes **3–15 seconds delay** for the first user request.

## Solution
We use an external service — **[cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/)** — to send a request to the backend every **1 minute**.  
This keeps the backend active and eliminates most cold start delays.
